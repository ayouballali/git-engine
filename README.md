# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a social media engine, where we can search for github's users by their name, and more than that, we can visit their repositories and their profile, I did that by using github's API and Axios the fetch my data.
I enjoyed doing this project.
